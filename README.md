# freecodecamp-micro-fes-intro

This repository contains my progress in the Micro-Frontends Course - Beginner to Expert, offered by freeCodeCamp. It serves as a comprehensive guide, detailing the step-by-step process I have followed throughout this crash course.

Please note that my progress is currently at the "Sharing the Cart" section as I have successfully went through all the necessary components that I needed to cover. 

For the original implementation, you can refer to the official repository [here](https://github.com/jherr/micro-fes-beginner-to-expert).
